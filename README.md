### Hi there ðŸ‘‹


**generalrowland/generalrowland** is a âœ¨ _special_ âœ¨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.

Here are some ideas to get you started:

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on a small little series where aiden pearce and the rest of my watchdog: legion ocs meet security breach
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning computer programing
- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on any projects relating to fallout or watchdigs
- ðŸ¤” Iâ€™m looking for help with editing
- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about how to make stop motion
- ðŸ“« How to reach me: phone number; 918-440-3931 email; ethandale0916@gmail.com
- ðŸ˜„ Pronouns: he/him
- âš¡ Fun fact: I know fallout lore, I have about 1-26 ocs(I think), I like to draw from time to time, I like to build stuff with legos
